          The Dharavi Slum has been attacked by many different diseases that
          have caused a loss of lives. The slum experienced its first plague
          back in 1896 when it severely suffered and almost lost half of its
          population. Slowly, more and more epidemics continued to critically
          affect the Dharavi Slum with high death rates; a few include typhoid,
          polio, and cholera. Patients with all the diseases were usually only
          brought to hospitals too late, which put them in critical care
          conditions. The coronavirus pandemic had indeed reached the Dharavi
          Slum and the first case was announced in April 2020. So far, there are
          about 900 cases, however, it is very possible for that number to be
          grossly underestimated due to the slumâ€™s population and population
          density.
