          The name &quot;Dharavi&quot; comes from the Tamil word for &quot;loose
          mud&quot;. The area was originally an island and mangrove swamp
          inhabited by Koli fishermen.

          Dharavi is easily one of the most recognized residential areas in the
          world. It is also one of the world’s largest slums. The geographical
          area is just over 2.39 sq. km in size but supports a population of
          about 300,000 to a million people. This means Dharavi is also one of
          the most densely populated residential areas in the world.

        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          Dharavi’s history goes back to 1884, the time when the city saw a huge
          migration of people from the rural areas to urban Mumbai. This was the
          city’s pocket where the maximum number of economically challenged
          population found residence. As the number of industries grew, so did
          the size of the slum area.

          In the 18th century, Dharavi was an island with a predominantly
          mangrove swamp. It was a sparsely populated village before the late
          19th century, inhabited by Koli fishermen. Dharavi was then referred
          to as the village of Koliwada.

        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          In the 1850s, after decades of urban growth under the East India
          Company and British Raj, the city&lsquo;s population reached half a
          million. The urban area then covered mostly the southern extension of
          Bombay peninsula, the population density was over 10 times higher than
          London at that time.

          The most polluting industries were tanneries, and the first tannery
          moved from peninsular Bombay into Dharavi in 1887. People who worked
          with leather, typically a profession of the lowest Hindu castes and of
          Muslim Indians, moved into Dharavi. Other early settlers included the
          Kumbhars, a large Gujarati community of potters. The colonial
          government granted them a 99-year land lease in 1895. Rural migrants
          looking for jobs poured into Bombay, and its population soared past 1
          million. Other artisans, like the embroidery workers from Uttar
          Pradesh, started the ready-made garments trade. These industries
          created jobs, and labor moved in, but there was no government effort
          to plan or invest in any infrastructure in or near Dharavi. The living
          quarters and small-scale factories grew haphazardly, without provision
          for sanitation, drains, safe drinking water, roads, or other basic
          services. However, some ethnic, caste, and religious communities that
          settled in Dharavi at that time helped build the settlement of Dharavi
          by forming organizations and political parties, building schools and
          temples, and constructing homes and factories. Dharavi&lsquo;s first
          mosque, Badi Masjid, started in 1887 and the oldest Hindu temple,
          Ganesh Mandir, was built in 1913.

        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          At India&lsquo;s independence from colonial rule in 1947, Dharavi had
          grown to be the largest slum in Bombay and all of India. It still had
          a few empty spaces, which continued to serve as waste-dumping grounds
          for operators across the city. Bombay, meanwhile, continued to grow as
          a city. Soon Dharavi was surrounded by the city and became a key hub
          for the informal economy. Starting from the 1950s, proposals for
          Dharavi redevelopment plans periodically came out, but most of these
          plans failed because of a lack of financial banking and/or political
          support. Dharavi&lsquo;s Co-operative Housing Society was formed in
          the 1960s to uplift the lives of thousands of slum dwellers by the
          initiative of Shri. M.V. Duraiswamy, a well-known social worker and
          Congress leader of that region. The society promoted 338 flats and 97
          shops and was named Dr. Baliga Nagar. By the late 20th century,
          Dharavi occupied about 175 hectares (432 acres), with an astounding
          population density of more than 2,900 people per hectare (1,200/acre).

          Dharavi has suffered from many epidemics and other disasters,
          including a widespread plague in 1896 which killed over half of the
          population of Bombay. Sanitation in the slums remains poor.

        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          Dharavi has an active informal economy in which numerous household
          enterprises employ many of the slum residents—leather, textiles, and
          pottery products are among the goods made inside Dharavi. The total
          annual turnover has been estimated at over US$1 billion.

          In the 1980s, Varadarajan Mudaliar was a powerful figure in the Mumbai
          underworld who ran a criminal empire in the Dharavi slums. He was
          involved in extortion, kidnapping, contract killing, land
          encroachment, illegal gambling, and liquor dens. Police officer Y.C.
          Pawar targeted Varadarajan and his gang, and by 1983, Varadarajan was
          forced to flee Mumbai.
