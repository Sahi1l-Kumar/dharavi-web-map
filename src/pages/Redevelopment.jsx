          In 2004, the Maharashtra state government envisaged Dharavi to be
          transformed into a cluster of high-rises with improved urban
          infrastructure. The project included relocating 68,000 people,
          including slum dwellers and those with commercial establishments. The
          state was to provide 300 sq ft houses for free to residents with proof
          that their slum structure was in existence before January 1, 2000, and
          for a price to those who settled in Dharavi between 2000 and 2011.

        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          In 2004, the Maharashtra government decided to redevelop Dharavi as an
          integrated planned township. It was decided to develop Dharavi by
          using land as a resource to cross-subsidize the cost of development
          through a sale component based on the slum rehabilitation scheme, by
          dividing it into sectors and appointing developers for the same. In
          addition, the government also decided to notify Dharavi as an
          undeveloped area and appoint a special planning authority to oversee
          its development.

          In November 2018, the then Fadnavis-led government approved a new
          model for the slumâ€™s redevelopment. Although Dubai-based
          infrastructure firm Seclink Technologies Corporation turned out to be
          a successful bidder in January 2019 against Adani, the tender was not
          awarded following the decision to include Railway land in the
          redevelopment project. In October 2020, the Uddhav Thackeray-led
          Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government canceled the tender and
          stated that new tenders would be floated soon. Also, Delay by the
          Centre in transferring the railway land, which was critical to the
          project.
